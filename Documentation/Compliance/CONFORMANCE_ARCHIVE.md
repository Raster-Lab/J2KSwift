## How to Generate an Archive Entry

### Swift API

```swift
import J2KCore

// Run the automation suite
let result = J2KConformanceAutomationRunner.runAllSuites()

// Create an archive entry
let entry = J2KConformanceArchive.createArchiveEntry(from: result)

// Generate a markdown report
let report = J2KConformanceArchive.generateArchiveReport(entry)
print(report)
```

### Command Line

```bash
# Run full conformance suite and generate report
./Scripts/run-conformance.sh --report

# Run specific part
./Scripts/run-conformance.sh --part 1 --report
```

## CI Integration

Conformance test archives are automatically generated by CI workflows:

- `.github/workflows/conformance.yml` — Runs on every push/PR to main, develop, release/*
- Conformance gate aggregates results from all part-specific jobs
- JP3D conformance report uploaded as CI artefact (90-day retention)

---

## Archiving Policy

- Archive entries are retained for the lifetime of the project repository
- Each major/minor release generates a new archive entry
- CI runs automatically produce artefacts for failed runs
- Certification reports are generated for each Part 4 validation run
