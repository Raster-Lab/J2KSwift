/// One-dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform implementation for JPEG 2000.
///
/// This module implements the 1D DWT using the lifting scheme, supporting both
/// the reversible 5/3 filter (for lossless compression) and the irreversible 9/7
/// filter (for lossy compression) as specified in ISO/IEC 15444-1.
///
/// The lifting scheme provides:
/// - Efficient in-place computation
/// - Integer-to-integer transforms (5/3 filter)
/// - Perfect reconstruction (both filters)
/// - Minimal memory requirements
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let signal: [Int32] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
/// let filter = J2KDWTFilter.reversible53
///
/// // Forward transform
/// let (lowpass, highpass) = try J2KDWT1D.forwardTransform(
///     signal: signal,
///     filter: filter,
///     boundaryExtension: .symmetric
/// )
///
/// // Inverse transform
/// let reconstructed = try J2KDWT1D.inverseTransform(
///     lowpass: lowpass,
///     highpass: highpass,
///     filter: filter,
///     boundaryExtension: .symmetric
/// )
