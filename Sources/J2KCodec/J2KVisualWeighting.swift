/// # JPEG 2000 Visual Frequency Weighting
///
/// Implementation of perceptual visual frequency weighting for JPEG 2000 encoding.
///
/// Visual frequency weighting applies frequency-dependent scaling to quantization
/// step sizes based on the human visual system's contrast sensitivity function (CSF).
/// This allows for perceptually optimized compression by allocating more bits to
/// frequency bands that are more visible to human observers.
///
/// ## Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF)
///
/// The CSF describes the human eye's sensitivity to spatial frequencies. Humans are
/// most sensitive to frequencies around 4-8 cycles per degree and less sensitive to
/// very low and very high frequencies. The implementation uses the Mannos-Sakrison CSF
/// model, which is well-suited for JPEG 2000 wavelet subbands.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create visual weighting with default CSF parameters
/// let weighting = J2KVisualWeighting()
///
/// // Calculate weight for a specific subband
/// let weight = weighting.weight(
///     for: .hh,
///     decompositionLevel: 2,
///     totalLevels: 5,
///     viewingDistance: 60.0  // cm
/// )
///
/// // Apply to quantization step size
/// let perceptualStepSize = baseStepSize * weight
/// ```
